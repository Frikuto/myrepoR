This is a line from RStudio

#Commit these changes to your local repo. How?

#From RStudio:
#Click the “Git” tab in upper right pane.
#Check “Staged” box for README.md.
#If you’re not already in the Git pop-up, click “Commit”.
#Type a message in “Commit message”, such as “Commit from RStudio”.
#Click “Commit”.

So, it worked and the # thingies don't show up!

Ok, no the # thingies show up, this is like copy-pasting an R script. It is just that before I didn't save after adding the # thingies.
